# Auto Heal Friendly Targets

If a healing ability is used, this automatically heals all targets that match the disposition of the actor that used the ability. If you specfifically want to heal a target with a different disposition, then you'll need to do that the old fashioned way. A chat card is printed out for each actor healed for verification purposes -- and if someone is healed that isn't then you know what needs undone.
