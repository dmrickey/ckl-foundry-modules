# Auto Heal Friendly Targets

If a healing ability is used, this automatically heals all targets that match the disposition of the actor that used the ability. If you specfifically want to heal a target with a different disposition, then you'll need to do that the old fashioned way. A chat card is printed out that lists each actor healed for verification purposes -- so if someone isn't healed that should be (or vice versa) then you can easily resolve it.
